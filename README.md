Team 2 MERN project.
Our goal was to create an application similar to Facebook, where users have relationships with other users, such as Follow/Unfollow and relationships with posts, such as Like/Unlike & Comment/Uncomment.
The CRUD operations for users and posts goes without saying. Picture upload for user profile and specific posts is also available as a feature. We have added an admin panel where the content and users of the platform can be moderated.
